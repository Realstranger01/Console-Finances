Edge
```

### Description

this project was designed using the concepts that were learned in class activity and should present a real-world situation in which newfound Javascript skills will come handy for creating code to analyse the financial records of a company.

### Installation

my installation process started with creating a repositry on my github account and shortly afterthat i have decided to clone the repositry to my local computer then i begin to deploy my project by using the git add, git commit and git push commands to save and push the code into my github repositry.  

### Usage

To improve the user's interactivity to the webpage i have added combine strings and variables in the console so the need to use concatenation is defined within Javascript to clearly describe its meaning to both the user and developer. 

### Behind The Scenes

Everything inside a Javascript function executes inside the execution context and the other part consists of components.
