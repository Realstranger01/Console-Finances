# Console Finance

In Javascript there is a beautiful elegant, highly expressive language that is buried under a steaming pile of good intentions and blunders.

## Getting started

Open up the [project link](https://realstranger01.github.io/Console-Finances/) and you should be able to see the webpage shown below:

![Console-Finance]( "Console-Finance")

You need to have a modern browser able to handle html5 and css.

Some popular browsers are:
```

Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Safari
Opera
Edge
```

### Description

this project was designed using the concepts that were learned in class activity and should present a real-world situation in which newfound Javascript skills will come handy for creating code to analyse the financial records of a company.

### Installation

my installation process started with creating a repositry on my github account and shortly afterthat i have decided to clone the repositry to my local computer then i begin to deploy my project by using the git add, git commit and git push commands to save and push the code into my github repositry.  

### Usage

To improve the user's interactivity to the webpage i have added combine strings and variables in the console so the need to use concatenation is defined within Javascript to clearly describe its meaning to both the user and developer. 

### Behind The Scenes

Everything inside a Javascript function executes inside the execution context and the other part consists of components.
